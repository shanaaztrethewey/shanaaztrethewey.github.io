      <description>&lt;p&gt;I guess before one reads a blog of a stranger, you may want to know who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t, I’m happy for you skip this part&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a person just like you – doing my best to navigate what life has offered me, both in challenges and opportunities!  Of course, we are also different, I have things about my life that may not even come close to anything you may have experienced and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is who I am –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a woman, a wife and a mother.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a professional who is part of the workforce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a business owner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am a creative person that tries art projects, writing kids books, building things and am currently learning how to play the piano.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked as an auditor, an investment banker, an operations and finance director, and a coach. And each of these experiences have shown me that there is commonality in the challenges we face – all leading to how we are seen, heard and how our needs are being met&amp;hellip;or more aptly – how our chosen actions to meet our needs are being interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this blog is all about this – just sharing, making observations and being human!&lt;/p&gt;
