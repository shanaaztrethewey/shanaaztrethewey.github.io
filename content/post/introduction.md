I guess before one reads a blog of a stranger, you may want to know who I am.

If you don’t, I’m happy for you skip this part...
 
I am a person just like you – doing my best to navigate what life has offered me, both in challenges and opportunities!  Of course, we are also different, I have things about my life that may not even come close to anything you may have experienced and vice versa.  
 
So this is who I am –
 
* I am a woman, a wife and a mother.
* I am a professional who is part of the workforce.
* I am a business owner.
* I am a creative person that tries art projects, writing kids books, building things and am currently learning how to play the piano.
 
I have worked as an auditor, an investment banker, an operations and finance director, and a coach. And each of these experiences have shown me that there is commonality in the challenges we face – all leading to how we are seen, heard and how our needs are being met...or more aptly – how our chosen actions to meet our needs are being interpreted.
 
So this blog is all about this – just sharing, making observations and being human!
