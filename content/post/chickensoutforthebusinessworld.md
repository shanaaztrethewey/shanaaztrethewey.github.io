Years ago, when I thought of myself as a corporate yuppie, I remember as soon I had a sniffle I would rush off to a doctor and ensure I walked out with some prescription that guaranteed I would be healed overnight.  This was because I probably had some deadline and meeting I could not move out.  

I would call someone who would sympathise – in many cases, my mother.  And she would send me some chicken soup.  Books are published about chicken soup for the soul, for the love life, for the friends and possibly every other topic.  But what about the good old use as an age old healer? For a moment I was transported back to comfort and wholeness as the chicken soup entered my mouth and filled my tummy. 

And this got me thinking - we seem to forget or discount ‘old fashioned ways’, and although it seems antiquated, there was some rationale to why things were done and how it impacted our outlook.  I am probably the first to ask anyone to provide me with reasons as to why we should do things as we have progressed significantly over the centuries and our knowledge has deepened – AND I still arrive as the same questions – what has happened to ‘old fashioned ways’?

Everything about the way we live has become representative of being “instant”.  Instant popcorn, instant protein shakes, instant connectivity.  So to what extent has this lead us to believe that the nature of things being instant, is pervasive to everything else – and mostly human dynamics.  
People are asked to respond to things immediately, and action solutions immediately. All of which becomes indicative of their performance and ultimately their worth on a pay check.

Are people instant and should we be expecting them to respond at the pace of technology and is being “instant” the culture we really would like? Is pausing for a moment to think or question so bad? Is time really money – or is money just a pressure point?

From where I stand – I would like to know we are surrounded by critical thinkers, people that take pride in what they do and people who are given the opportunity to take initiative.  And I am not sure this comes from expecting instant reactions – I believe it comes from allowing people the space to determine the pace they need to work at and also allowing them to adapt to changing circumstances.  Its only natural after allowing this that a person will become invested in the outcome if they are truly understand the process to getting there.  Having to react without thought and understanding, feels like we have taken the human out of human behaviour.  And yet as a massive contradiction, we expect to see age old values of respect, honesty and commitment?  Maybe we need to take the humanity from the ways of the past and see how it can work for us today.

I have become so conscious of what “chicken soup” means to each of us and how we have discounted it. What does this mean in terms of the behaviour when we walk into our working environments? I don’t have the answers to these questions.  I do know I want to be human and have comfort in being just that.  And I can only be human if I remind myself that everyone else is human too.  This feels more like a sustainable future to me.
